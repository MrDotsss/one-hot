# 🎯 One-S-hot

## 💥 Overview

**One-S-hot** (read: "One Shot") is a fast-paced, high-mobility first-person sniper shooter where every shot demands decisive precision.  
Forget sitting on rooftops — in this game, sniping is a close-to-mid-range *art of momentum*, built on aggressive movement and perfect flicks.

## 🚀 Key Features

- ⚡ **Hyper Movement:** Wallrun, slide, air dash, crouch-slide cancel — master momentum to survive and outmaneuver enemies.
- 🎯 **Sniper-Only Arsenal:** One iconic sniper rifle, **HAWP**, with three bullet types (standard, piercing, bouncing). No crosshair dependency — pure skill shots.
- 🌀 **Time Slow Mechanic:** Enter a focused slow-motion aim state. Fail to shoot in time? You’re punished for hesitation and must recover.
- 🤖 **Enemy Variants:** 
  - Capsule-shaped **Shots**: sniper-type enemies that track from long range.
  - Sphere-shaped **Bursts**: shotgun-style close chasers with quick bursts.
  - Cube-shaped **Rapids**: static mid-range gatling enemies.
- ⚔️ **Boss Encounter:** Battle **ATANA**, the autonomous robotic swordsman, if you dare to answer *"Are you truly ready?"*
- 🏹 **Perk System:** Gain up to 3 perks during your run to subtly support your style without removing the core aiming challenge.
